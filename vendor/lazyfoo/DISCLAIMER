ltimer.h and ltimer.cpp in this directory are put together from lazyfoo.net

"""
Q: Can I use your code to make a game?

A: Basically my rules are:
1) If you're using it for a closed source program, go nuts.
2) If you're using it for an open source program, please cite the chunks of code you used with something like:

/*This piece of code was originally from Lazy Foo' Productions
(http://lazyfoo.net/)*/

3) If you're using it for a GPL, LGPL or other such program which gives public rights to the code, I'm going to have to say no.
4) If you're using it for a tutorial, you're going to have to use your own original code.

You still need contact me and show me specifically the code you plan to use and what you're going to do with it so I can approve.
